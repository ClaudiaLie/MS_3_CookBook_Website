## **User Experience (UX)** <a name="user-experience"></a>
The main focus of A Tavola is to have a clean and intuitive website on the front-end, with a full user access to the C.R.U.D. functionality (Create, Read, Update and Delete) simply navigating throught the pages. In addition to that, the back-end needs a good solid structure to make the search of the recipes and the navigation easier for the user.

### **User Stories** <a name="stories"></a>

1. _As a_ **first time visitor**, _I need to_ **understand the purpose of the site**, _in order to_ **consider exploring the site further**.

2. _As a_ **first time visitor**, _I need to_ **quickly and easily register on the site**,  _in order to_ **fully interact with the site**.
   
3. _As a_ **first time visitor**, _I need to_ **easily access the recipe collection**, _in order to_ **search for a recipe worth making**.

4. _As a_ **returning user**, _I need_ **an interface where I can upload and save my recipes**, _in order to_ **share my favourite recipes with other site users**.

5. _As a_ **returning user**, _I need to_ **have the ability to edit or delete a recipe I have uploaded** _in order to_ **make changes to, or remove an out of date or incorrect recipe**.

6. _As a _ **site owner**, _I need to_ **ensure some basic access control to edit and delete functionality**, _in order to_ **prevent unauthorised editing or deletion of user uploaded data**.

7.  _As a _ **site owner**, _I need to_ **have a unique feature which generates some competition between users**, _in order to_ **encourage users to post new recipes**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.
